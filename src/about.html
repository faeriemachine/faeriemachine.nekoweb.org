            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm a currently-25-year-old gay androgyne guy from so-called Canada, living on Algonquin-Anishinaabe land with <a href="/pets">my cat</a>. I use he, she and fae pronouns, and sometimes I may be an animal in the shape of a vampire bat, serval, zebra, or Scottish Fold. I love to play and draw.</p>
            <h3>I like to make things!</h3>
            <p>I've always been one to create, ever since I learned how to pick up a pencil! 2D illustration is my mainstay, but I also dabble in other artforms like fursuit building, coding (like this site!), photography, and just recently, 3D modeling! I have an extensive history of mediums that I've at least dipped my toes into, and I'm frequently trying out new things with my art.</p>

            <h3>I like the internet!</h3>

            <p>My history on the 'net is expansive, having been introduced to the computer at just 3 years old, and finding out about the websites <em>Club Penguin</em> and <em>Webkinz</em> at around 6 years old. As soon as I found out about the magic of the internet, it became solidified as an important part of my life, for better and for worse. Thanks to having this tool readily available to me, I was able to discover so much about myself and find communities with people who I would consider to be close friends of mine! Of course, my time on the Internet hasn't always been sunshine and rainbows, but that goes without saying, and I prefer to focus on how the Internet has helped me become the person I am today.</p>
            <p>Outside of that, I'd pick up some coding knowledge here and there over the years, and would attempt a few of my own web dev projects several times since the release of <em>Neocities.</em> Of course, none of my stuff was really that good, but coding was something I always came back to as something I really enjoyed learning about (even through all of the frustration it causes.) My first pieces of coding knowledge would come from sites like <em>DeviantArt</em> and <em>Tumblr</em>, and eventually to that of <em>Toyhouse</em> and <em>ArtFight</em>.</em></p>

            <h3>I'm disabled!</h3>

            <p>I consider this to be a very important and all-encompassing part of myself and my life, as I am multiply disabled both by birth and by acquistion. My conditions affect my every waking moment, and are unavoidable when you get to know me.</p>
            <p>Specifically, I have Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos, Fibromyalgia, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (<em>or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, which I personally hate</em>), migraine with aura, and Dysautonomia, amongst other commorbidities. I was diagnosed with all of these in the past 7 years, and finding the right treatment since then has been difficult. Unlucky for me, I happen to have all of the conditions where nobody knows what the fuck is actually happening in the body for them to occur, so treatment is based on symptom management rather than addressing the root cause. Personally, I think that <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/autoimmunity-neuroinflammation-in-fibromyalgia-5197944" target="_blank">Fibromyalgia has a high possibility of being autoimmune</a>, and that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12151296/" target="_blank">mitochondrial dysfunction playing a major role in how debilitating ME is</a>, but that's just what I think.</p>
            <p>With my case unfortunately being very treatment-resistant, I use medical cannabis for the majority of my symptom management, alongside experimenting with low-dose Naltrexone. Because of this, I am a huge advocate for the complete legalization and decriminalization of cannabis for all uses, including medical, recreational, and spiritual. Even with my current treatment plan, I still remain moderately disabled by my conditions, with over 70% of my functioning having been lost, so there's a lot I am unable to do and miss out on. Contrary to popular belief, however, my life isn't exclusively about how miserable I am, and I still manage to find ways to still enjoy life, even with my constant suffering!</p>
            <p>I am also moderately Autistic and developmentally disabled with several learning disabilities (US-CA definition, <em>I'm not intellectually disabled!</em>), dyspraxia, and dyscalculia, which impact my every day life on a significant basis. Because of my Autism, I was also late to start speaking, and speech problems have continued throughout my entire life. Therefore, I sometimes use various forms of AAC in order to help me communicate! I have custom-made communication cards attached to my sunflower lanyard for short and generalized phrases, and I also use the apps TD Snap and Speech Assistant on my iPad as my choice of high-tech <a href="https://www.assistiveware.com/learn-aac/what-is-aac" title="Augmentative Alternative Communication" target="_blank">AAC</a>!</p>
            <p>I'm also psychologically disabled with various mental health conditions. I don't feel comfortable sharing too much about my mental health, but I struggle a lot with dissociation, anxiety, psychosis, mood disorders, and post-traumatic stress.</p>
          
            <h3>Why <em>FaerieMachine?</em></h3>

            <p>FaerieMachine came out as an alias I made originally for a new Instagram page I made back in 2021 to post about my interest in toy robots at the time. The name kinda stuck for me in other places of the internet though, expanding to encapsulate the more personal and intimate side of my internet presence!</p>
            <p>As for why I chose <em>Faerie</em> as part of the alias, I'm fae <a href="/alterhuman">alterhuman</a>, and I feel like the legend of fairies really fits with my personality and overall identity in a single word!</p>

            <h2>Special interests!</h2>
            <p>I only have a few things that I'd consider to truly fit the definition of being a 'special interest,' since these are the things that I feel shape me as a human being! You can't separate my special interests from me, they're that important to my identity!</p>

        <div class="box" id="introduction">
            <p>Welcome to my page all about my alterhuman identities! I personally see alterhuman as an umbrella term for all the ways in which I experience non-humanity, including being otherkin, fictionkin, and therian!</p>
            <p>If you don't know what all of this is, I recommend checking out my <a href="https://otherkinity.neocities.org/" target="_blank">my friend's website</a> as a good introduction to the world of alterhumanity, therianthropy, and otherkinity!</p>
            <p>My experience with alterhumanity started sometime around 2014, with Tumblr being my first introduction to the phenomenon. Before, I had always had very strong psychological connections with certain animals and fictional characters, but never had the terminology to describe what I was experiencing. Now, over a deacade later, being alterhuman is still a very important part of my identity, even with many people on social media seeing it as something that's "immature" or "childish."</p>
            <p>A lot of my reasons for being this way mostly come down to psychological and emotional factors, especially with my identity problems as a symptom of mental illness, but I hope to start exploring the spiritual side of my identities too one day!</p>
            <p><strong>I'm okay with doubles for all of these!</strong></p>

            <p>Oh Radar, where to begin with you... I suppose I can start with the fact that my awakening in him was almost instant. From the moment I started watching M*A*SH in 2022, I would end up finding so many similarities between myself and him, to the point where he's become one of my highest identifying fictionkin types. I feel he represents a side of me that's more childlike and na√Øve, thrown into the tense enviroment that is a U.S. Army field hospital unit. Despite this, we're both highly resourceful to the people around us, we're both fairly savvy and knowledgeable, and we both have a bit of a devious side to us!</p>

            <p>This one was just recently awakened in me, but even before I started playing Echo, I knew there was a connection between TJ and I- something that even my friends vouched for. He was also the route I ended up going for first, which may or may not have been the best idea, as his story ended up being the most dread-inducing. Him and I are similar in many ways, with the both of us having been brought up from a religious background, as well as us both dealing with anxiety since childhood. We're also both very charitable and sensitive, which unfortunately ends with us getting taken advantage of pretty often. </p>

            <p>Okay so I know how this looks having him here, but I consider Norman to be who I'd be if I were a much worse person. Much of my identity in him stems from trauma, having had an incredibly tragic upbringing that would shape the person (or, rather, multiple people) he would become. I know that having him on my kinlist is a red flag, but I like to imagine that I am the kind of person Norman could've become if he had any opportunities to heal and better himself. The curse of being dutiful and obedient to authority figures who end up being all you have or know is real, to say the least...</p>

            <div class="subtitle"><a href="https://echoproject.fandom.com/wiki/TJ_Hess" target="_blank">Cyril Figgis</a> | Archer</div>
            <p>Yes, another red flag of a kin, I realize there's a trend happening here, but Cyril at least shows <em>some</em> progress as a human being throughout the show's run. Still an absolute manchild regardless, Cyril is another example of my worst traits dialed up to 100, all stemming from his father's constant disproval towards anything he did. With a deep-seated insecurity in his masculinity, Cyril is prone to experiencing an extreme amount of emotional dysfunction that has rendered him bookish, awkward, and lacking self-confidence- all things that I myself have experienced while at my lowest points in life.</p>

            <p>So, this isn't related to being alterhuman whatsoever, but it's still a very important part of my identity, hence it's inclusion here... I'm a <a href="https://www.discussingdissociation.com/2009/05/introjects-what-are-introjects/" target="_blank">fictional introject</a> of Eddie Kaspbrak from It! Specifically the 2017 and 2019 movies (which are pretty bad, by the way,) but my identity also takes some beats from the original book and miniseries adaptation.</p>
            <p><strong>Please please please, for the love of god, treat me like a normal human being despite this. My existence does not start and end at being an interpretation of a fictional character, and I'm tired of seeing fictional introjects be reduced to just 'being that character but in real life.'</strong> Just because this is important to me, doesn't mean it has to be important to you, and my identity has since grown to encapsulate more than just who I was when I started to exist.</p>

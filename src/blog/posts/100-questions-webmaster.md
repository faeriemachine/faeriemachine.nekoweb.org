Blog post inspiration has been few and far between, so here's a questionnaire meme, courtesy of <a href="https://mouseling.net/100webmaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mouseling</a>

---

<dl>
<dt>1. Please introduce yourself.</dt>
<dd>I'm Kian or Eddie. Yes I have two names, and no I don't have a preference.</dd>

<dt>2. How long have you been making websites?</dt>
<dd>Since around 2017 I wanna say, but those first few websites were either made with preexisting templates, or were so shoddily put together that they barely functioned. I only started to get really into webdev around 2023 or so, when I coded my first site layout from scratch.</dd>

<dt>3. And what got you into the hobby?</dt>
<dd>I don't remember 👍 I know I've tried to make handcoded websites as extensions to my social media profiles several times, but coding websites was something that I always struggled to make sense of. That was until I picked it back up in 2022 to make yet another 'About me' page for my social media accounts, which lead me to look more into the culture of Neocities and the indie web. </dd>

<dt>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</dt>
<dd>Sites that say things that make me think about things from a different perspective, especially when it's something that's important to the webmaster</dd>

<dt>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</dt>
<dd>I'm a very visual person, so I like drawing out blueprints of possible layouts for websites before I take the leap into writing the CSS for them. I also tend to write whatever content I want on my sites in Obsidian in markdown before converting required pages into HTML. </dd>

<dt>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</dt>
<dd>I'm too shyyyy but everyone I have linked on <a href="links">/links</a> inspires me greatly</dd>

<dt>7. What's your favourite part about making websites?</dt>
<dd>The fact that I have to do everything myself! Which can also be a source of frustration, but I love anything to do with DIY, so making my own websites just feels natural to me.</dd>

<dt>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</dt>
<dd>I'm not sure if there's one specific thing I struggle with <em>the most</em>. I guess Javascript? Because most of the time I just use other's scripts I find across the web and on W3Schools, because I don't actually know how to write JS yet. </dd>

<dt>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</dt>
<dd>I used to have different ones, but for some reason I feel like I enjoy it way more when websites are uniform and use the same layout. I dunno, maybe it's because I find websites having different layouts on every page to be overwhelming and overstimulating, I haven't really thought about why.</dd>

<dt>10. How confident are you with CSS?</dt>
<dd>I love it, so I'd say I'm pretty confident.</dd>

<dt>11. Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?</dt>
<dd>Well now I do thanks to this questionnaire's blank file.</dd>

<dt>12. What is your favourite HTML element?</dt>
<dd>div</dd>

<dt>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</dt>
<dd>Blueprints!! It's where I figure out what content I want and how I want to present it.</dd>

<dt>14. Do you know JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>No, see question 8.</dd>

<dt>15. How about PHP?</dt>
<dd>Nada. I use webhosts that don't have PHP support, so I haven't had a reason to learn yet.</dd>

<dt>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</dt>
<dd>For this site, it's mostly just whatever I like. You could say my site's theme is 'cute' and I wouldn't be opposed to that.</dd>

<dt>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</dt>
<dd>I like a healthy mix of both on my personal site (where you are now), but I heavily prioritised content on my art website in order to maximise accessibility, since it also doubles as the place where I get commissions from.</dd>

<dt>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</dt>
<dd>Yes! <a href="https://tri4ge.icu/" target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tri4ge.icu</a>. Although I'd love to own triage.icu, but someone's already taken it and hasn't even done anything with it!</dd>

<dt>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</dt>
<dd>Cool when done right and with an actual drive for revitalising the Indie Web scene, especially when someone goes the extra mile to make it as accessible as possible. I appreciate people who are dedicated to keeping an aesthetic alive through a genuine appreciation for it, rather than trying to get in on a trend.</dd>

<dt>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</dt>
<dd>I really should check my HTML validity more than I do LOL. But as of writing this, it isn't, so I'll have to fix that sometime.</dd>

<dt>21. What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</dt>
<dd>They're cool, I like being able to showcase a little piece of my favourite websites on my own. </dd>

<dt>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</dt>
<dd>Also cool, but should be kept to their own dedicated pages in my opinion. Otherwise they can be a bit of a nightmare accessibility and loading wise.</dd>

<dt>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</dt>
<dd>For this site? I'd probably keep it at least somewhat similar, since the purpose of it is to showcase things that are important to me personally.</dd>

<dt>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</dt>
<dd>A little, haha. I'm trying not to be though, because I hate seeing things like this as a competition. We should be supporting and inspiring each other to make our websites better as a community!</dd>

<dt>25. What text editor do you use?</dt>
<dd>VSCodium!</dd>

<dt>26. Why do you use that one?</dt>
<dd>Easy, can use the terminal in it to code, like the extensions, and also no tracking with Codium specifically.</dd>

<dt>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</dt>
<dd>Always always always from my own website, I've made the mistake of not doing that way too many times.</dd>

<dt>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</dt>
<dd>I personally prefer Nekoweb, but it really is down to just what your preference is. Otherwise they're fairly similar and offer many of the same perks.</dd>

<dt>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</dt>
<dd>No idea.</dd>

<dt>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</dt>
<dd>Yes always!!</dd>

<dt>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</dt>
<dd>I like a fine balance between simplicity and visuals, but I tend to err more on the side of simplistic sites, because they tend to be less overwhelming for me personally. But all in all, it depends on personal preference, as well as the goal of the website's design.</dd>

<dt>32. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</dt>
<dd>So for this site I like to center my design around my own personal aesthetic which includes a lot of pinks yellows, and purples. Whereas for my art site I always associate it with blues, reds, pale yellows and oranges because I have the medical aesthetic going on with my art brand. </dd>

<dt>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</dt>
<dd>No, and I don't think I will any time soon because I enjoy having a website!</dd>

<dt>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</dt>
<dd>Yes I do :) You know who you are.</dd>

<dt>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</dt>
<dd>They know about my art site, but probably not this one. If they do, then I probably trust them quite a bit.</dd>

<dt>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</dt>
<dd>No, I tend to forget to update it actually lol. Which is something I want to improve on, but it takes more steps to upload something new to my website than it does to social media.</dd>

<dt>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>In some ways yes, but in other ways I don't. If my site has certain colours that I associate with it then I'll likely keep those, as well as loosely basing my designs off of their previous styles, but otherwise I really enjoy coming up with something new every time.</dd>

<dt>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</dt>
<dd>All three honestly! It's centered around myself, what I enjoy, and how I see the world around me, so I like to think I have a healthy mix of all three.</dd>

<dt>39. Do you do web design professionally?</dt>
<dd>I don't, no.</dd>

<dt>40. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</dt>
<dd>I don't think I'd really enjoy it that much if I made it into a job. Plus heavily disabled, unable to work (even remotely), yadda yadda.</dd>

<dt>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</dt>
<dd>Only for art commission work.</dd>

<dt>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</dt>
<dd>Websites are great and I think everyone should have one, but I don't think it even stands a chance against the amount of connection that social media brings. The way social media connects us has both positive and negative results, and while I like to think my usage brings more positives for me than negatives, but those negatives still get to me frequently. Not like I have much of a choice though, being a lower-functioning disabled guy.</dd>

<dt>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</dt>
<dd>BetterDiscord 👍</dd>

<dt>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</dt>
<dd>Yes! I don't necessarily have a specific artist or genre I listen to while coding though, it's just whatever I wanna play at the moment.</dd>

<dt>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</dt>
<dd>I have more than one, and I plan on making a few more for other topics I wish to cover!</dd>

<dt>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</dt>
<dd>I tend to keep my sites relevant to the topic(s) they're about. I.E. this site is about everything personal to me, while my art site is related to anything creative and furry.</dd>

<dt>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</dt>
<dd>I try to present my real self on this website at least, but I do have my limits on what I'm willing to share here.</dd>

<dt>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</dt>
<dd>Not yet, but I imagine it can happen int he future!</dd>

<dt>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</dt>
<dd>Right now, yes! I'm at least at a place where I think my work is up to standard with my current coding knowledge. I'm sure I'll look back at the way this site looks and cringe at how I did certain things, but that's part of learning.</dd>

<dt>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</dt>
<dd>Please stop bombarding your website with flashing, saturated gifs and background images. Your photosensitive visitors will be thankful if you  at least warn them beforehand.</dd>

<dt>51. What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?</dt>
<dd>Mobile layouts! Responsiveness! Or at least some very basic accessibility practices!! </dd>

<dt>52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</dt>
<dd>I made myself learn semantic over generic early on into coding full websites, but I'm sure that I could be better at it.</dd>

<dt>53. Do you consider different browsers?</dt>
<dd>I try to, at least.</dd>

<dt>54. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</dt>
<dd>Waterfox, which is just a fork of Firefox without the stupid AI bullshit they recently came out with. Also not Chrominum.</dd>

<dt>55. And what OS are you on?</dt>
<dd>EndeavourOS btw</dd>

<dt>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</dt>
<dd>Linux is like, one of the best things ever in my opinion, but I know some people are bound to Windows or Mac due to needing it for their job or just not finding Linux accessible for their needs. Both of which are totally understandable reasons, I'm not here too tell people to switch to Linux and if they don't then they're stupid. But I do think anyone who's even the tiniest bit interested in it should give it a shot and load up a virtual machine with their chosen distro. You never know until you try 😉 (Also EndeavourOS is the best especially if you want the Arch Linux experience without it being Arch Linux)</dd>

<dt>57. Are your websites mobile-friendly?</dt>
<dd>I try my hardest to make them mobile-friendly, yes! They may not be 100% perfect, but I try to make sure as many people can see my site as possible.</dd>

<dt>58. What are your thoughts on autoplay?</dt>
<dd>Hate it. Annoying, distracting, and always scares the shit out of me even when given adequate warnings for it.</dd>

<dt>59. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</dt>
<dd>They're cool, but I'm scared to join more because I feel like my website is subpar 🥲</dd>

<dt>60. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page?</dt>
<dd>I have a couple, and I plan to make more in the future! I do still need to remake my music shrine, but I have plans to make shrines for some favourite media, my plushies and Furbies, and a favourite musician of mine.</dd>

<dt>61. Are your websites "cliche", in your opinion?</dt>
<dd>Not sure, honestly. I don't really have a frame of reference for what counts as a "cliche" website. I like to think my site is unique to myself, though.</dd>

<dt>62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</dt>
<dd>I want a website that makes people think about things and want to revisit it. Other than that I dunno, I just make what I like here.</dd>

<dt>63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</dt>
<dd>I draw a lot of my own assets for my art website! But for here, I'm okay with using assets that I find from around the web. </dd>

<dt>64. What are your favourite resource sites?</dt>
<dd><a href="https://pixelsafari.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PixelSafari</a></dd>

<dt>65. Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</dt>
<dd>Not sure if I can think of any. If I notice a bad coding habit of mine, then I try to stop doing it as soon as possible.</dd>

<dt>66. What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</dt>
<dd>Site-making will go a whole lot smoother if you actually take the time to plan out your site, even a little bit! Nobody has to go the route I do where I draw out template ideas in my notebook or in image editing software, but at least having an idea of what you want your site to look like and say will make things much less of a headache once you start coding everything. I also highly recommend doing some web-surfing and looking at other peoples' sites to get some inspiration! Many webmasters don't like to be copied, but most don't mind inspiration being taken from their sites.</dd>

<dt>67. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</dt>
<dd>I keep all styling in my CSS files, unless in a few instances where I need to style a specific element.</dd>

<dt>68. What do you think of frameset layouts?</dt>
<dd>Don't really know enough about them to have an opinion.</dd>

<dt>69. How about table-based layouts?</dt>
<dd>I've been guilty of making these way back when I knew nothing about making websites LOL</dd>

<dt>70. Do you subscribe to the ideas of "one-column", "two-column" and "three-column" layouts? Do you use any of these?</dt>
<dd>Not really a subscriber to any of these specific ideas, I just use whatever layout I need at the time.</dd>

<dt>71. Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS?</dt>
<dd>CSS, easily. I feel like I'm constantly tweaking my CSS whenever I code!</dd>

<dt>72. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</dt>
<dd>No, and I don't really have any interest in doing so. </dd>

<dt>73. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</dt>
<dd>I really only make layouts when I need them.</dd>

<dt>74. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</dt>
<dd>Somewhere in the middle, probably. I know more than a lot of others who are just getting started with coding, but I will always have so much more to learn.</dd>

<dt>75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</dt>
<dd>I try not to, but I admit that I've done it a few times if I'm particularly stuck on something with coding my own sites... 😅</dd>

<dt>76. How did YOU learn how to make websites?</dt>
<dd>Editing templates, which I don't necessarily recommend for newbies. It restricts what you're able to do, unless you know how to tear apart these templates to make something that looks nothing like the original.</dd>

<dt>77. Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</dt>
<dd>Maybe a little bit.</dd>

<dt>78. Thoughts on floating elements?</dt>
<dd>Not my favourite for accessibility & responsiveness reasons.</dd>

<dt>79. When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</dt>
<dd>For fonts I always use EM/REM. For sizing containers I use a mix of all three, and for images it tends to be %. </dd>

<dt>80. Do you have a favourite font?</dt>
<dd><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mali">Mali</a>.</dd>

<dt>81. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</dt>
<dd>I don't at the moment, but it's something I'm interested in doing in the future!</dd>

<dt>82. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</dt>
<dd>I do! I really enjoy seeing what other people have on their personal sites and witnessing a showcase of what's important to them.</dd>

<dt>83. Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</dt>
<dd>I don't, but I really should! It'd be flattering if others ever bookmarked my sites though!</dd>

<dt>84. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</dt>
<dd>Gonna be honest, but I don't see my website as anything impressive. I'm still a huge novice at this and like to keep my stuff basic!</dd>

<dt>85. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</dt>
<dd>Yes, but I don't really collect much because I don't have the space. I currently have my PC (which I'm using to type this on), my two laptops, my iPad for art and AAC and a CRT TV/VHS Player with it's own DVD player, though.</dd>

<dt>86. How often and for how long are you online?</dt>
<dd>Too often and for too long.</dd>

<dt>87. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</dt>
<dd>Anyone who gives a shit about anything I have to say.</dd>

<dt>88. Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</dt>
<dd>I'm not sure! It looks neat, but I think it'd trip me up because I'm so used to writing standard HTML.</dd>

<dt>89. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>Nope 🥲 I have plans to finally sit down and learn JS and Python one day though!</dd>

<dt>90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</dt>
<dd>I love Eleventy with all my heart, but I'm also interested in learning Astro and Hugo in the future.</dd>

<dt>91. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>No, things like that don't really mean anything to me.</dd>

<dt>92. Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</dt>
<dd>I don't, and I'm not sure if I'm really interested in doing so.</dd>

<dt>93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</dt>
<dd>Most times I'll write all of my page content in Obsidian first, but other times I'll write it directly in the editor. It depends.</dd>

<dt>94. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?</dt>
<dd>Others say I'm cool, but I'm not so sure about that myself!</dd>

<dt>95. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</dt>
<dd>Yes 🥲 I've deleted a lot of my old artwork before a certain point out of shame, and I no longer have the 1.0 layout of this website.</dd>

<dt>96. Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?</dt>
<dd>Probably leave it as an archive.</dd>

<dt>97. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</dt>
<dd>I probably reveal a little <em>too much</em> about myself on here...</dd>

<dt>98. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</dt>
<dd>My best friend is my partner! They don't have a website though.</dd>

<dt>99. And do you optimise the images on your website?</dt>
<dd>I should, but I don't LOL</dd>

<dt>100. We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? ....other than exhausted.</dt>
<dd>Indifferent.</dd>

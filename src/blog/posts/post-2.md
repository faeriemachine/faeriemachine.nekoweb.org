I can't sit still for the life of me and my mind can't stop racing; I'm finally meeting my partner, and I made the trip official just a few days ago! I really do mean it when I say that it's all I can think about, I don't think I've ever been more excited for something in my life, especially when we've been together for four years now and it's a topic that consistently comes up as something we've always wanted to do. But to think that it's finally happening, after years of me being so in love with them and wanting to show them a fraction of how much I love them, that in just under 2 months I'm going to be with the love of my life. I just don't know how I'm gonna be able to get through these next 2 months without exploding, I just wish I could sleep and have someone wake me up once January is here.

In other news... I've recently finished the foamwork for my fursuit head! This is my fourth fursuit head overall, but it definitely feels like it's my first run because I barely remember anything from making the first three fursuits LOL. But I still think it's going alright- it's certainly a challenge, but it's one that I've been enjoying thoroughly! What *will* be a good challenge next, though, is getting my mannequin head prepared for taping the inner lining- never have I ever modified a mannequin head, nor have I ever made any kind of lining to any of my fursuit parts in the past. Most of the time I'd just glue shit onto a balaclava mask and hope for the best, but since these balaclavas were made to keep you warm in the winter they became like ovens to wear. I definitely don't recommend doing this for any fursuit project ever and would advise any beginners to either just sink the extra money into getting a pre-build balaclava made specifically for fursuiting, or spend the extra time and resources to learn how to make your own.
  
I don't quite like the idea of live-blogging about my mental state to the entire internet, but just to give a surface-level summary of what's been going on with me as of late; things could definitely be better. The cause of all this stress is beyond me at this point, as I just can't remember what exactly got me over the edge, but I was in a state of perpetual hyperarousal - as my therapist likes to put it - where everything is extra heightened because of whatever triggered me into this state. I've at least managed to keep myself afloat to this point, which I suppose is an achievement in itself, but with my trip now being official I feel as though a light has switched inside of my head. Finally, after so long, I have something tangible to work for, actual plans happening in my life that I've been working towards for ages, and need to continue working for to make sure it comes to fruition. Don't get me wrong, this alone hasn't cured me of everything and I'm still dealing with a lot of overwhelm, but I feel like my outlook on things have gotten a lot better, at least for the near future.
  
Soon I hope to return to physiotherapy for some maintenance check-ups before I leave for my trip, just to make sure that things are in good enough working order as I can get them to be before I put my body through what I imagine will be a lot of strain, but I'm at least sure that this strain will be completely worth it.

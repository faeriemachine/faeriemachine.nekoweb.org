Hi everyone. Where do I even begin with everything that's happened since my last journal entry...

Suppose I can start with the fact that I'm currently working on coding my art website (err... *was*. You'll see why in a little bit) and it's going.. okay, I guess. There's many new techniques I've been trying with this website that are a lot more ambitious and put this website to shame, as well as building layouts completely from scratch. I still need to go back and view what my beta testers have written for me in terms of the site's performance and accessibility and apply them to my site, but it was getting pretty close to launching and I had expected it to launch by the end of the month.

Yeah... that was before I got sick, and out of every other health problem in the entire world, I got one of the most painful ones- shingles.

And painful it was, to the point where I couldn't sit on my chair for very long as the rash happened to be on my left hip, completely nerfing my ability to code right then and there. Plus, I was extremely exhausted, both from the virus kicking my ass, and from the antivirals and Lyrica I was prescribed. I'm much better now- my rash is completely gone aside from some scarring that has remained, and I'm pain free, but I'm still feeling fairly exhausted since my body is having to play catch-up for the 2 weeks where I was stuck in my room and sleeping most of the day because I felt like a complete zombie.

That's the other thing- did you all know that getting sick can make OCD symptoms flare up and become much worse? I've also been having to deal with that over the past week or so as a result of being so physically and mentally exhausted from fighting the shingles. It's something I'm still recovering from after riding out the episode- the worst is certainly over, but I'm still suffering from my cycles and I'm completely wrung out of my energy. Please, never develop OCD, and never get shingles while we're at it. Get fucking vaccinated, please.

So I haven't really had the chance to sit down and code or draw anything since getting shingles, mainly because I am so exhausted and, therefore, demotivated to do anything remotely creative at the moment. It's a good thing I don't have any commissions to do right now, I'd feel terrible if someone had just commissioned me, only for me to come down with the world's most painful virus that sucked me of all my energy. Although lately I've been trying to express my creativity through my plushies and toy collection, since it's a good way for me to get my mind out of my sickness and focused on something more stimulating. I like being able to create lore and stories about my toys, and once I'm feeling better I'd like to start drawing them more, too.

Other than that, I'm just really trying to hang in there. I've been doing quite a bit of thrifting lately too, so I'll need to get back into updating my thrift log very soon. Most of my time has been spent in my room though, because everything else has been so exhausting for me. I really hope I can get over this soon, I'm afraid of going back to the state I was in back in April because that lasted for a long time, and I thought I was finally getting over it.

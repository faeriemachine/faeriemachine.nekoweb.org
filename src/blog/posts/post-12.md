Last journal entry was back in April for Furnal Equinox, it's about time I updated this page with some new life happenings.
          
To start off with the biggest thing... I got major surgery done! I'm not too comfortable sharing *what kind* of surgery took place- those who know will know. Regardless, I got the surgery done on the 19th of June, and as of writing this, I just had my second post-op appointment with my surgeon to go over the rest of my recovery (which is said to last for about 3 more weeks.) He says I'm recovering very well by the way! In fact, he says that I'm *above average* for healing, which I find really funny considering my hEDS diagnosis.
          
Preparing for and recovering from the surgery has been taking up my time, since I received the email with my date at the start of the month. Yes, they really did just barely give me two weeks to prepare- admittedly, it caught me off guard when I was given the news about the next available date because of how soon it was happening. Before I knew it, I was having my pre-op appointment with the anesthesiologist just a week before, and soon the big day came and went. Now, I've just been recovering from it all- it was a big surgery with a sizable impact on my body, so while I've been able to keep my pain under control, my exhaustion has been through the roof!
          
As stated before, the initial recovery phase takes about 4 weeks in total, but full recovery can take anywhere up to 6 months, to even a full year for the body to completely settle. I knew this going into the surgery, but I guess I underestimated how completely wiped I would be. Especially when the first day or two of surgery felt like a piece of cake- I felt a lot more spry than anybody anticipated, considering the fact that I still had to get the anesthesia out of my body. It really started to hit me on the third day, and ever since then I've felt completely wiped. I've been trying to keep myself busy by doing some artwork and playing a bit of Club Penguin Journey, but otherwise my fatigue has been too overwhelming to sustain my attention span for very long.
          
On the topic of things to keep myself busy, I've been wanting to start getting back into coding again, as I have a few new projects in mind that I want to get started on. I really, *really* want a new journal page that's been recoded from the ground up, and this will involve having to learn 11ty, something that I keep putting off continuing to do out of fear. It's not like it doesn't make sense to me because I'm starting slow to make sure that I understand everything, but what I don't understand is how my knowledge eventually will end up creating entire websites from the ground up. I think perhaps I just need to continue with my lessons and wait for that to present itself to me, but I'm also that type of impatient twat who skips the tutorial of video games and expects himself to know what he's doing right off the bat, and then gets really mad when he naturally doesn't. Still, I might just push myself to get back into learning it soon, taking it one lesson at a time so that I don't overexert my already exhausted mind. 
          
In terms of the near future, I do have CanFURence in August to look forward to! Because of my surgery, I'm not sure if I'll be able to fursuit at the convention (I'll have to ask my surgeon about it during my next appointment with him,) but I still make a point of going to the con every year. Although, this might be my last year where I'll get to room by myself, and this totally isn't a subliminal message to anyone who might be going next year who would be interested in sharing a room with me...*wink wink, nudge nudge.* It's just getting too expensive for me to continue paying for by myself, and I think it'd also make it fun to be able to room with a few other people. Plus, I have a feeling that the convention will be moving hotels once it's contract with the Delta is finished, as it's noticeably cramp having over 1,000 people coming in and out of the hotel space at a time.
          
Otherwise, I don't have too much planned for the future that's really that notable. My surgery has taken up most of my time, and while that is something I did mentally and physically prepare for, it also makes it hard to tell others what I've been up to, because I just spend most of my time resting.

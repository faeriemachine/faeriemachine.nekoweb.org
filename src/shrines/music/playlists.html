   Hi there! I see you're peaking at my website- no worries, I don't mind if you're wanting to see how I did something
   for reference! Just please don't copy-paste my stuff without at least *some* kind of modification/personalization to it...

<p>I love making playlists, so naturally I had to make a page dedicated to all of the playlists I've made and make all of YOU see them!</p>

<h2>Favourites/On Repeat</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4XJTDpPOsbSKoECutsCmua?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>If you're just here to get an idea of what my favourites are, then here you go. I try to keep this as updated as possible, but when you have over 4,000 songs in your library it can get a bit messy.</p>
<p>Expect any genre of music to appear here, regardless of their relation to other tracks.</p>

<h2>Jungle/DnB</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4wftritntcA7dmLWzXPqdY?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Ahhh, good ole' jungle... this and D'n'B were some of my first loves when it came to electronic music in general, and I have a ton of appreciation for both of these genres! </p>
<p>I aim to keep this playlist full of both old and new material to keep it fresh, while also making sure to pay homage to the founders of the genre.</p>

<h2>Breakcore</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/28WDLC0PPoNxW16YP3z4H3?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>I realize it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I like breakcore for how high-energy and loud it is. You know that one Tumblr post someone wrote about being an autistic person with sensory issues, while also really liking shit like breakcore? That's basically me, and I think that the way I rationalize my love for such noisy music is the fact that this is like a form of controlled sensory seeking, and if it ever becomes too much for me, then I have the power to stop it.</p>

<h2>Electronic Rock/Metal</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2icP5Bjf0tQ2dwHdOadyuH?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Basically a playlist that answers the question of "What if we made that electric guitar <i>even more</i> electronic?" Admittedly, this is one of my more neglected playlists, so please excuse how short it is.</p>

<h2>Furry-Made Music!</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3Rb8wV4qbbnK1HnVsXJyg7?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>My favourites in furry-made music!! May include some offline files since I like to stream my Bandcamp purchases through Spotify and just like to keep everything categorized for my own sake.</p>
<p>Not all of the music in here is speedcore breakcore bullshit, but it is more EDM focused as that's what I have the most experience with listening to for now.</p>

<h2>That Bastard Known as Nostalgia</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3tWWuvvC5zIbs50z3RJZf0?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Playlist to dye your fur and gossip about your enemy's boyfriend to your sparklefur friend to. This is my playlist for when I want to relish in the freedom of being a cringe sparklefur roaming through the trenches of DeviantArt.</p>
<p>This doesn't focus so much on specific genres and more on vibes, but I promise you that there's no hyperpop in here.</p>

<h2>Pop/Hip-Hop/Dance Nostalgia</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0nYSLeEXETqaZG0RSnSbZg?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Remember how I said that some of my first experiences with listening to music was from top 40's pop and hip-hop? Well, this was what I was listening to at the time! Also mixed in with some things that released after that period, just to make the vibe of this playlist even more obvious.</p>


<h2>Slow Tempo</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6SYiTuJzpmkJD2KQwRwoMB?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>This is where the songs that make me feel a painful sense of nostalgia go, with a common theme of them being relatively slow in tempo and speed. A type of relaxation that makes you full with dread and a bittersweet taste for the past.</p>

<h2>Vomit songs</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5rOPDu2hPxq71o06RPNiWe?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Self-explanatory.</p>

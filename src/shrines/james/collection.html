<h2>My Collection</h2>

  <p>This is my current collection of James items that I own! In order of when I received them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Wooden Railway Lights and Sounds James:</strong> This was my first ever James item since I started rebuilding my Thomas collection, and I bought him off of Ebay! He's missing one of his back wheels, so he's a 0-5-0 instead. And yes, this is one of the toys that was notoriously part of the 2007 lead paint crisis.</li>
    <li><strong>James In A Mess book:</strong> The first book I got of James, at the same time as my copy of <i>James And The Red Balloon!</i> I got the both of them at my local flea market, which has a large library of books, including tons of Thomas books! Of course, I had to get the ones that were James-related.</li>
    <li><strong>James And The Red Balloon book:</strong> My second James book, gotten at the same time and place as my other book! Not much to say about this book, it really is just one of those books that retells the stories from various episodes.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Someone Happy VHS tape:</strong> I got this in a combined package with my Capsule Plarail and ERTL James toys, partly because it's a VHS that focuses on James with him being on the cover, but also because I just like collecting VHS tapes of my favourite media! THe VHS works beautifully, and it's a very nostalgic way for me to watch Thomas media!</li>
    <li><strong>Capsule Plarail James:</strong> As stated before, I got this little guy in the same lot as my ERTL James and VHS tape, and I think he's such a delight! I also got a few track pieces and a tar tanker with him, but currently don't display him with either of them. Nonetheless, I think he's adorable, and I can't wait to add more Capsule Plarail items to my collection!</li>
    <li><strong>ERTL diecast James:</strong> The last of these bundled purchases was the ERTL diecast James toy, who was made in 2001. I never actually grew up with ERTL Thomas toys and was exclusively a Wooden Railway kid, but now that I own one, I can see why they're so beloved in the Thomas community! I hope I can add a few more ERTL James' to my collection in the future, I really love them!</li>
    <li><strong>Take & Play James</strong> This is probably one of my favourite James toys so far- I love his face and open cab! Again, the Take & Play series wasn't one I ever grew up with personally, but it's likely going to become another favourite of mine, as I do hope to collect other engines besides James in this series!</li>
    <li><strong>HO Scale Bachmann James:</strong> My holy grail for a good while was an HO scale Bachmann James, and this one came to me at just the right time I feel! Granted this one well-used, and he is missing his front wheels and buffers, but I still love him all the same. Especially since I don't have any actual layouts to run him on, I was perfectly fine with getting one in this condition. Plus, curiously, the listing original labled him as a 'Motorized Trackmaster,' and I assume it's because of this and it's imperfections that made it so affordable. I really do believe that the stars aligned for me to get him, because his listing was up for the entire week that I debated on getting him!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As of typing this, I'm also working on a big ita bag project based off of James! I don't have much to show for it right now, but this page will be updated when I start working on it!</p>

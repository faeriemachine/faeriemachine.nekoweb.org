<h2>My Collection</h2>
<div id="paragraph">
  <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Last updated:</b> <i>15/05/25</i></p>
  <img src="/james/images/jamescollection.jpg" style="width: 100%;border-radius: 25px;box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);" alt="James merch collection">
  <p>This is my current collection of James items that I own!</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Wooden Railway Lights and Sounds James:</b> This was my first ever James item since I started rebuilding my Thomas collection, and I bought him off of Ebay! He's missing one of his back wheels, so he's a 0-5-0 instead. And yes, this is one of the toys that was notoriously part of the 2007 lead paint crisis.</li>
    <li><b>James In A Mess book:</b> The first book I got of James, at the same time as my copy of <i>James And The Red Balloon!</i> I got the both of them at my local flea market, which has a large library of books, including tons of Thomas books! Of course, I had to get the ones that were James-related.</li>
    <li><b>James And The Red Balloon book:</b> My second James book, gotten at the same time and place as my other book! Not much to say about this book, it really is just one of those books that retells the stories from various episodes.</li>
    <li><b>Make Someone Happy VHS tape:</b> I got this in a combined package with my Capsule Plarail and ERTL James toys, partly because it's a VHS that focuses on James with him being on the cover, but also because I just like collecting VHS tapes of my favourite media! THe VHS works beautifully, and it's a very nostalgic way for me to watch Thomas media!</li>
    <li><b>Capsule Plarail James:</b> As stated before, I got this little guy in the same lot as my ERTL James and VHS tape, and I think he's such a delight! I also got a few track pieces and a tar tanker with him, but currently don't display him with either of them. Nonetheless, I think he's adorable, and I can't wait to add more Capsule Plarail items to my collection!</li>
    <li><b>ERTL diecast James:</b> The last of my most recent purchases is the ERTL diecast James toy, who was made in 2001. I never actually grew up with ERTL Thomas toys and was exclusively a Wooden Railway kid, but now that I own one, I can see why they're so beloved in the Thomas community! I hope I can add a few more ERTL James' to my collection in the future, I really love them!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As of typing this, I'm also working on a big ita bag project based off of James! I don't have much to show for it right now, but this page will be updated when I start working on it!</p>

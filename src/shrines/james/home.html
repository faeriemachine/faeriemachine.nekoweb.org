<h3>What in the world is this??</h3>
<div id="paragraph">
    <p>For those who are unaware of what this is, there's a lot of different terms used for the similar, shared experience of loving fictional characters in a sexual, romantic, or even platonic manner. Here's a quick rundown of terminology you might find on personal website shrines like this:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Self-ship</b>: Rather self-explanatory, the act of shipping oneself with a fictional character, similar to that of shipping two 'canon' characters together. This can be used as a verb or a noun.</li>
        <li><b>Yumejoshi/Yumedanshi</b>:  A set of Japanese-orginated terms for those who ship themselves with a fictional character, with the former being the feminine term, and the latter being the masculine term. A variety of gender-neutral terms have been developed as well, such as 'yumejin,' 'yumebito' or 'yumehito.' A neutral catchall for anyone who engages in the practice is 'yume.'</li>
        <li><b>Fictosexual</b>: A sexual orientation that describes an attraction towards fictional characters, and is often but not always an exclusive attraction, with asexuality towards real people as a common defining factor. A similar term, <i>semifictosexual</i>, may be used by those who experience sexual attraction towards both real people and fictional characters.</li>
        <li><b>Riako</b>: A fem-aligned Japanese term that originated from gyaru and idol fan spaces, meaning 'real love,' and is used to denote a person who views the love for their F/O as being the same as that of a real relationship. The masculine equivalent is 'gachikoi.'</li>
        <li><b>Fictional other</b>: The term for the fictional character a selfshipper or yume ships themselves with. While the term is most often used for romantic or romance-adjacent ships, this isn't always the case, and may also be used for platonic and familial dynamics as well.</li>
        <li><b>Comfort character</b>: A term for a character that brings comfort to an individual, without the use of a self insert. As such, this is not exclusive to self-shipping, and may or may not be romantic in nature.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>I have more questions...</h3>
<div id="paragraph" class="p2">
    <div id="faq1">
        <p><b>Are you okay?</b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="faq2">
        <p>I'm fundamentally a better and more sound-of-mind person with James in my life, thanks for asking!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="faq1">
        <p><b>What terminology do you identify with?</b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="faq2">
        <p>Personally, I align myself with self-ship and yume terminology, while also being semifictosexual and objectum! Objectum meaning that I experience sexual and romantic attraction towards objects- an identity I find also coincides with my semifictosexuality!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="faq1">
        <p><b>So you also find IRL people attractive?</b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="faq2">
        <p>Very much so! I have no shortage of celebrity crushes, and I'm in a very loving relationship with a real person as well! I know this is frowned upon in certain spaces (<i>looking at you, r/waifuism,</i>) but I personally don't care.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="faq1">
        <p><b>Are you active in the TTTE/RWS community?</b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="faq2">
        <p>Kinda..?? I have a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/nwr5" target="_blank">Tumblr sideblog</a> dedicated to it, and sometimes interact with the fandom on Twitter for artwork and memes, but other than that I don't really have any interest in participating in fandom activities, outside of maybe IRL meetups in the future. The only way I feel like I can interact with fandom is if we're also touching grass as we interact.</p>

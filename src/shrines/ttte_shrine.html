        <h1>Welcome to the island of Sodor...!!</h1>

        <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/ygqoel.gif" alt="Engine shed door" align="right" style="padding:5px;"> 

        <p>If you've been around me for a good amount of time, then you'll probably know that my first ever special interest was the TV series <i>Thomas The Tank Engine,</i> with my passion starting as young as just 2 years of age. Of course, I can't actually remember this time of my life since it's perfectly natural for amnesia to occur for these early childhood years, but my parents can vouch for the fact that I was, indeed, Thomas obsessed. So Thomas obsessed in fact, that I was one of those kids who grew up having a whole Wooden Railway train table!! Again, I have no memories of ever having this train table in my life, but my parents say that I would spend hours playing with it, until I would eventually grow out of Thomas when I was around 7 or 8. Even so, I still kept Thomas very close to my heart for the following years after the TV series guided me during my first few years of life.</p>

        <p><p>I think it's only natural that I ended up revisiting the franchise later in my life, nearly 20 years later, but what I didn't expect was to fall back in love with it again as I did when I was 2 years old!</p></p>

        <p>This site will showcase some of the things I love the most about the series, including a rundown of the franchise's history, my favourite characters and episodes, and my own collection of Thomas-related merchandise!</p>

        <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/ol4xfl.gif" class="center" alt="null" style="padding: 5px">

        <h3>But you're an adult, why <I>Thomas?</I></h3>

        <p>Listen, I get it, being into a show about anthropomorphic talking trains made for preschoolers as an adult is weird. Even calling myself an "adult Thomas The Tank Engine fan" is weird, and I get that it's a very niche interest for me to have at my age. I don't deny that the show has it's target demographic, nor do I think it's ever been "adult-oriented," but I argue that many elements within the franchise - especially in the books and the earlier series of the TV show - are meant to appeal to an all-ages audience rather than just children. I don't mean to sound like one of those people who want to deny what their favourite children's media is and pretend that it's much darker than it really is, but there were many times where Thomas The Tank Engine wasn't afraid to be more grounded and realistic with the stories it told. (I'll get to why this is in the past-tense in a little bit...)</p>

        <p>I also just find it hilariously hypocritical the way people see adult Thomas fans as being anymore "cringe" than an adult fan of franchises like Super Mario, Sonic, Spongebob, Steven Universe, or Transformers. Hell, I'd even argue that adult fans of Bluey, Sesame Street, and, to an extent, My Little Pony, are more understood if you want to compare examples of other preschooler's media with large adult followings! But as soon as you mention that you're a fan of something like Thomas, people look at you weirdly when they really shouldn't. It's all "Cringe culture is dead!!" until someone <i>actually</i> has an interest that you deem to be cringe-worthy, <i>I see how it is...</i></p>

        <h3>What drew you back into Thomas?</h3>

        <p>Admittedly, when I was first getting back into Thomas, I almost wrote off the series entirely, because I was under the impression that the newer material, such as the <i>Big World! Big Adventures!</i> and <i>All Engines Go!</i> rebrands, were what Thomas always was and that I was just severely nostalgia-poisoned into thinking that it was ever good. The thing is, Thomas <i>was</i> good, Thomas is <i>still</i> good, I was just looking in the wrong place because of what was available on my cable television channels at the time.</p>

        <p>The thing is, since the peak of my Thomas special interest happened when I was too young to remember it, I grew up having very little memories of the show, despite the fact that my parents vouch that I was obsessed with Thomas. I unfortunately never remembered any details about my Thomas obsession from back then, including my favourite characters or most memorable episodes, so getting back into the franchise was like I was getting into it for the first time all over again. Couple that with the fact that I was also just recently getting back into watching live TV that was airing <i>Big World! Big Adventures!</i> at the time, and you get me, thinking that Thomas wasn't all that I had thought it was because I just assumed that the franchise was always like BWBA.</p>

        <p>It wasn't until I revisited the first couple seasons of the show where I was able to fall in love with the franchise all over again. There really is so much to love about the series- the amount of detail put into the models and the sets they're filmed in, the amazing and nostalgic score, the memorable stories that I know are going to stick with me for much longer this time around, the lovable cast of characters, the verbose language and dialogue, the way Sodor appears like a real place that children could possibly visit... I could go on and on, but there's a reason why Thomas is as well-known as it is! It's just unfortunate with how it's being treated in the current day.</p>

        <h3>The Autistic Appeal of Thomas</h3>
        
        <p>If you've been in and around the Autism community, you might see Thomas popping up rather frequently, and that's not by mistake!</p>
        
        <p>As stated before, Thomas The Tank Engine was my first ever special interest when I was just 2 years old, but it's evident that I am not the only one who's had similar experiences with Thomas! Indeed, there is an evident appeal about Thomas that intrigues Autistic people from far and wide, and it isn't just because it's about trains!</p>
        
        <p>This connection between Thomas and Autism is so prevalent, in fact, that the National Autistic Society from the UK <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/autism-group-probes-why-children-love-thomas-the-tank-engine-1.638645" target="_blank">did a small study on it in April of 2007</a>, which made some very interesting discoveries! Out of the 748 UK parents of autistic children under 10 who participated in the survey, it was revealed that 58% of parents identified Thomas and their Autistic children's first preferred character, and was a notable favourite activity for those who exhibit restricted interests. One parent to a nine-year-old Autistic boy even cites that "Thomas & Friends is 100% responsible for getting him talking. Thomas was his life." In fact, up to a third of parents to Autistic children observed that their children learned to recognize basic facial expressions from the characters, clearly evident by the amount of memes that exist of the characters' exaggerated expressions that the series loved to use to clearly express how they were feeling. With all this said, it's no wonder that 54% of parents noted that the stories of Thomas contributed to their child's sense of security.</p>
        
        <p>Most interestingly, however, is the fact that this survey makes note of how long Autistic children hold onto Thomas! It was found that Autistic children continued to enjoy Thomas stories and characters for up to two years longer than their siblings who aren't Autistic, and I argue that for many of us, this interest lives on for much longer. I mean, hell, <i>look at me!</i></p>
        <p>As for <i>why</i> Thomas is such a popular choice of character and media for Autistic people, I think there's a couple reasons. The more obvious one about the characters having clear, exaggerated expressions has already been discussed, but somewhat related to this is the fact that Thomas serves as a way for Autistic people to learn how to deal with social problems! All of the characters feel realistic, and while many people would call TTTE a mean-spirited show for this, I think the fact that the characters don't always get along helps Autistic people understand that real people aren't always going to get along with each other, but it teaches us <i>how</i> to deal with people who we don't get along with.</p>

        <p>There's another element to the show in particular that Max Keogh of Sodor Island Fansite covers in his article titled <a href="https://www.sodor-island.com/thomasautismessay" target="_blank"><i>Thomas, Autism & Learning Difficulties</i></a>, which would be the fact that Thomas is a show that utilizes narration in the delivery of it's stories! Between Ringo Starr, Michael Angelis, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin, amongst others, the narration is a staple part of Thomas The Tank Engine, and Max remarks that "When you listen to, or watch, Thomas... the narration always remains calm, clear and soothing. For some people with autism, story recall and narrative coherence can be difficult... Thomas, immediately, breaks down this barrier, by the narration being spoken with a slow, methodical tone that allows people with autism to process each story beat clearly, at their own pace." This element is so intertwined with Thomas as a franchise, to the point where it can be seen as far back as the 1962 audio book recordings of The Raulway Series by Johnny Morris and Willie Rushton! Indeed, as someone who's also struggled with media literacy due to my Autism-related learning difficulties, Thomas serves as a stepping stone for me to practice following along with story beats, with the narration acting as 'training wheels' of sorts!</p>

        <p>I also believe that the fact that the main cast of characters are all anthropomorphic trains is very appealing to those of us with Autism, not only because these are trains we're talking about, but also because I believe that the concept of anthropomorphism is generally very appealing to us. From animals to plants and objects, I feel like we as Autistic people tend to see ourselves more in anthropomorphized beings rather than actual humans, since we have a tendency to feel very alienated from our peers. At least, this is reason why <i>I</i> as an autistic person feel a deep connection with anthropomorphic animals and objects, because they feel much more relatable to me than human characters.</p>

        <p>With all this said, it's no wonder why Thomas The Tank Engine has solidified itself as an important part of Autism culture, which is something I will always stand by! I know a lot of people see the studies being done in conjunction with former brand owner HiT Entertainment as just a brand deal and don't regard Autism to be a part of why they like Thomas, but I personally believe that Thomas The Tank Engine is a show that caters towards Autistic people, whether this was intentional or not. If anything, I feel like the reason liking TTTE as a adult is seen as 'cringe' is because of the fact that it's often associated with the developmentally disabled, and I just feel like people either aren't recognizing this connection within their heads, or they do and are already ableist towards us to begin with.</p>

      <h1>The History of Thomas The Tank Engine</h1>

      <h3>Humble beginnings - The Railway Series</h3>

      <h3>The television adaptation of The Railway Series</h3>

      <p>t58j4wyj860yj605</p>

      <h3>What's up with the franchise now?</h3>

      <p>A loaded question, as it's been in a perpetual state of either being mediocre at best, or downright trashy and even offensive (which I know is a pretty loaded accusation to make on a show about talking trains, but bear with me here for a second.) When this started depends on who you ask, but I think it's safe to say that after the commercial and critical failure that was the first feature-length Thomas film, <i>Thomas And The Magic Railroad,</i> the franchise hasn't been the same ever since, as the creator the show, Britt Allcroft, was forced to step down in the wake of the movie's colossal failure. Some would also point to HiT Entertainment's acquisition of Gullane Entertainment - formerly known as The Britt Allcroft Company - for the release of the show's 8th series. This was also when the infamous <i>Thomas and Friends Writers' Bible</i> would come into existence, which was rife with goofs that ranged from model details, to character descriptions that were wildly out-of-character. Then there was the shift from models to CGI for the movie <i>Hero Of The Rails</i> and the subsequent series to come after, starting with series 12, which would effectively change the face of the show for the rest of it's run.</p>

      <p>From all of these time periods, episodes would range in quality, from being pretty good, to being half decent, and then being completely unwatchable. When there were diamonds in the rough, they were treasured by fans, but bumps in the road were felt immensely as the series kept coming out under HiT Entertainment. What's also notable about the HiT era, as fans like to call it, is how the franchise began to be marketed towards a younger audience than the first five seasons of the show. Before, it was generally regarded as a show that the entire family could enjoy, rather than it being specifically for the preschooler demographic.</p>

      <p>In 2012, HiT Entertainment would be bought out by Mattel, just a year before the release of series 13. This would also be the year where <i>Nitrogen Studios</i> would part ways with HiT Entertainment after finishing up production on the movie <i>Blue Mountain Mystery</i>, and when head writer Sharon Miller would step down from her position. Many would regard this era as being the best of the CGI series, with Andrew Brenner as head writer, and I have to agree! The episodes almost have the same feel as that of <i>My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,</i> where it's still clearly targeted towards young children, but is clever with it's comedy and really leans into the worldbuilding aspect of the Thomas franchise. By the time series 21 was released, however, HiT Entertainment was finally rebranded as Mattel Creations for business and distribution reasons. This would also mark the beginning of the development of the reboot, <i>Big World! Big Adventures!,</i> with eight episodes from the season being cancelled.</p>

      <p>The reboot of the series into <i>Big World! Big Adventures!</i> would come about as a result of declining toy sales caused by the increasing popularity of the show's competitors- most notably, <i>PAW Patrol.</i> Funnily enough, it's said that Mattel was intrigued by a suggestion that had come from a (still unnamed) child who said, and I quote: "Trains can go places but Thomas never goes anywhere," leading to the brilliant idea that Thomas was to travel around the globe and learn about the different cultures of the countries where Mattel wished to expand the franchise to.</p>

      <p>Suffice to say, <i>Big World! Big Adventures!</i> was yet another failure for the franchise, as the reboot would end just two seasons in. Going into the issues with the show would take me ages to type and you a long time to read, so instead I am recommending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x340CrIryFA" target="_blank">this video</a> by YouTube user The Unlucky Tug for anyone who is interested. In short; the series was rife with poor writing choices made by a team of old, white, and out-of-touch executives who wanted the franchise to be perceived as one that's becoming "more progressive" with the introduction of new characters from the cultures that they represent- this decision would end up biting them on the ass due to how flat, boring, stereotypical, and sometimes even downright racist, these characters and cultural showcases ended up being.</p>

      <p>If anything, BWBA was created in order for Mattel to get the name of their dying franchise into the headlines for the strides they appeared to be making with creating the first female main characters (a complete lie, by the way, because we have Emily who's literally a part of Tidmouth sheds) and the first African steam engine character. Not only this, but Mattel also made the grand decision to remove two of the oldest and most beloved characters, Edward and Henry, in place of the two new female leads, Nia and Rebecca. As great as it is in theory to introduce new, more diverse characters from different parts of the world onto the island of Sodor, the way Mattel went about it was sloppy, careless, and offensive. Again, if you're interested to know more, you'll be able to learn everything about where the reboot went wrong in the video linked above.</p>

      <p>With another failure on their hands and the franchise on life support, Mattel would then announce a second installment that would be entirely 2D animated by Canadian animation studio, Nelvana. It would also be revealed that this would take place in an entirely different canon than the rest of the franchise thus far, and would feature "a new look and story structure," original songs, and Thomas as the lead character of every episode. Unfortunately for Mattel, <i>All Engines Go!</i> was met with even more rounds of backlash from both fans and parents, with some even saying "<a href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/tv-and-film-parents-dont-like-thomas-the-tank-engines-awful-new-makeover-20210910">their kids cried at the redesigns of the characters.</a>" Hilariously, this reboot would last longer than BWBA by two seasons, ending at it's fourth that's in the middle of airing in 2025, as of typing this.</p>
      
      <p>In my personal, grown-adult opinion, Thomas has unfortunately become a shell of it's former self, and while I want to remain cautiously optimistic about the success of the newly rebooted <i>Thomas Wooden Railway</i> toyline (EDIT 27/04/25: Well, not anymore. Seems like they've since canceled that toyline as well,) I also believe that so long as Mattel has ownership over the franchise, that they'll continue to make the most out-of-touch decisions for the show as possible, all for the sake of earning all of the money they've lost from bestowing one failure after the next onto the franchise. Which comes as a bit of a shock, since Mattel were the ones to introduce a very strong cast for the aptly named 'Brenner era' of the original series' run. But I suppose that good things never last, and that investors hold more power over our favourite pieces of media more than they should.</p>

      <p>Despite this, I still think the classic series (Series 1 to 5), as well as the original <i>The Railway Series</i> books, are such special and cozy pieces of media that I'd recommend to anyone who are fans of this kind of stuff. Make no mistake that the franchise is definitely still geared towards kids throughout it's entire run, but I think there's plenty for us adults to enjoy with the earliest seasons and the books, that I think it's absolutely worth giving it a shot if you're ever bored and want something to watch that's more mellow and easy to digest.</p>

      <h3>What's does the future hold for Thomas?</h3>
      
      <p>If I'm being honest, I have no idea. With All Engines Go! slated to end later this year and the recently rebooted Wooden Railway toyline coming to an end as well, it's difficult to have a good idea of what the future holds for the Thomas franchise. 2025 marks the 80th anniversary for the Railway Series, which has brought us many exciting new toylines, models, and a new Japanese documentary! But as for any long-term plans, we're still very much in the dark, and I truly don't know how to feel.</p>
      
      <p>After the box office success that was the <i>Barbie movie</i>, Mattel has also <a href="https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/master-mattel-cinematic-universe-robbie-brenner-barbie-1236328520/" target="_blank">talked about producing a new Thomas movie</a>. Thomas The Tank Engine isn't any stranger to movies, but this was also the thing that would change the franchise forever. So while I am cautiously optimistic about the idea of this movie reinvigorating the Thomas franchise from some horrible past reboots, I'm also not trying to get my hopes up too much, considering the treatment the franchise has gotten by Mattel in recent years.</p>
      
      <p>We're in a phase where there's lots of different directions the franchise could take next, and we have no idea which path they're going to take with our favourite talking trains next, but I hope that the colossal failure of BWBA and the mediocrity that was AEG has taught Mattel how <i>not</i> to treat the franchise.</p>

      <h1>Franchise Favourites</h1>

      <h2>Characters</h2>

      <h3>James The Red Engine</h3>

      <img src="https://files.catbox.moe/lz46go.gif" alt="James the red engine rolling his eyes around happily" align="left" style="padding:10px;width: 28%;">

      <p>James is easily my favourite TTTE/RWS character of all time! He's a mixed-traffic tender engine who's proud, vain, narcissistic, and even boastful to an extent, but has a heart of gold hiding behind all of that pride! He likes to sometimes play tricks on the other engines, though he knows when he's gone too far and will apologize to those he's hurt with his jokes. Although he will tease those who appear as being old-fashioned, weak, slow, or dirty to him, he will often end up in a situation where he needs the help of those whom he's poked fun at, and ends up being apologetic of his insults and becomes good friends with them.</p>

      <p>I think what draws me towards James is the fact that he comes off as being a very flawed character with how cocky he is, despite him never really doing anything to back up his high image of himself. Don't get me wrong, he's a character with a lot of ugly and obvious flaws, but that's what I love about him! He's often so caught up in his self-image that he will go the lengths of putting the other engines down in order to raise himself up on a pedestal. Despite all of this though, deep within him is a heart that truly cares and wants to make a difference, willing to drop everything in order to help his friends when they're in need. He's also not completely without a conscious, often quietly mourning for himself and others once he realizes when he's crossed a line. Just like all of the other engines on Sodor, James wishes to be the most responsible, reliable, and useful version of himself that he can possibly be.</p>

      <p>James may be vain and proud, but he's a very silly little engine who truly does care for his fellow locomotives. He makes me very happy, and has charmed his way into my heart.</p>

      <h1>Merchandise Collection</h1>

      <p>As of writing this section of my shrine, I don't actually have <i>that many</i> pieces of merchandise, but I figured I'd show what I do have for the sake of it.</p>

      <h2>Physical media - Books</h2>

      <p>As of writing this, I only have one book in my collection, but it's become one of my prized possessions for the very fact that it's a compilation book of original Railway Series stories.</p>

      <h2>Physical media - DVDs</h2>

      <h2>Toys</h2>

      <p>I have a few toys in my humble little TTTE merch collection!</p>

                        <h2>14/02/26</h2>
                        <p>Writing this on Valentine's Day in the spirit of the holiday, and also because I can't help but to gush about you! </p>
                        
                        <p>It's been a hell of a year for me, what with getting surgery and having my health decline to a degree that deeply frightened me. There was a good moment in my life where I thought that I was done for, and our relationship wouldn't be the same as a result. But you've always been so understanding and open-minded for me. You've shown me that I'm always going to be loved, no matter how much worse my health may get, and that means the world to me. Out of everyone on this planet, out of all the people that could've ended up being my soulmate, it was you, and I'm so endlessly thankful for that.</p>

                        <p>It feels so right to be with you. I feel we fit so perfectly together, like puzzle pieces that were made for each other and to stick together. We compliment each other so well that we really are a package deal, and I truly have never been happier being with someone than I am being with you. You're the moon to my sun, my life partner, and you fit into my life so seamlessly that it feels like we've known each other for much longer than we have.</p>

                        <p>I've truly become a much better, more mature person since I met you. I struggled a lot to feel like I was worthy of anyone's attention, and like there was nobody who really understood me or cared about me enough to be anyone's first pick. I've also battled with many trauma responses that are admittedly still ingrained into my being, and it resulted in me showing a lot of emotional immaturity in my past relationships. But your patience, kindness, and willingness to give me time and space to grow has changed my life for the better, and I can't even imagine what it would've been like if we hadn't crossed paths.</p>

                        <p>You've always been my rock during high tides, my safety net when it feels like things are crashing down on me. No matter how much shit I'd go through during our relationship, you never gave up on me, and I'm so endlessly grateful. I hope that I've been able to give the same amount of love, care and attention as you have for me, because I never want you to forget how adored you are. I love every single part of you, especially those that you feel self-conscious about, and I want to worship everything about you.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for being a part of my life, it makes me feel like the luckiest man alive to love and be loved by someone as incredible as you. No matter what lies in our future, I know that being able to live domestically together one day is going to make everything worth it. I'll never give up on you, I'll keep fighting for you, and I'll do everything I can to secure a good life for the both of us.</p>

                        <p>I love you so much. </p>

                        <p>Thank you for being the best thing that's ever happened to me, and always being there to cheer me on and always remind me that I'm worth it. I've never been so happy to call someone my soulmate, my other half, my moon and stars, and I want to be there for you like you've always been there for me. From the time we first met, I always knew there was something so special about you, something that told me that you were always the one for me, and I truly believe that fate has brought us together in a way that I've never experienced before until you came along.</p>
                        
                        <p>There's so much I could say about how special you are! You're always so caring when I'm in a rough spot, so understanding when I struggle with my health, and so patient when I need to take more time to do things than other people. You also always know how to make me laugh, you always know how to make me feel loved, and you always make me feel like I'm home whenever I'm talking with you.</p>

                        <p>It feels so right to be with you. I feel we fit so perfectly together, like puzzle pieces that were made for each other and to stick together. We compliment each other so well that we really are a package deal, and I truly have never been happier being with someone than I am being with you. You're the moon to my sun, my life partner, and you fit into my life so seamlessly that it feels like we've known each other for much longer than we have.</p>

                        <p>You've changed my entire life permanently, and for the better. Because of you, I've learned how to grow kinder, become more accepting and open-minded, and find confidence in myself for things that I never would've imagined I'd ever feel good about. You've left a mark on my life, and it's still the best thing that's ever happened to me.</p>

                        <p>You're the best partner I could've ever asked for, and I can't wait for us to have a life together, and I hope to be there for you as much as you've been there for me.</p>

                        <p>Would you believe me if I said that everything came to be thanks to an Armenian-American metal band? No really, that's how we met!</p>

                        <p>Specifically, we met because I drew a piece of fanart of Serj Tankian—frontman of said metal band called System of a Down—which Ghost also happened to be into at the time, and posted it to my (now abandoned) DeviantArt account. Thankfully, one of their friends was watching me at the time (and I think I was even mutuals with them this whole time? Not knowing that he was also friends with Ghost!) and sent the fanart their way, and they loved it!</p>

                        <p>From there they followed me on my more personal social media platforms (Twitter and Tumblr specifically) and I followed them back, seeing as they also liked SOAD as much as I did at the time. Eventually this would lead to us sharing Discord tags, and we began talking almost every day since then!</p>

                        <p>Over time with talking to each other, however, we found that we had a lot of other shared interests—toys and toy collecting, vintage and antique things, horror media, and music (in general) are just a few of the interests we share amongst each other. We would start talking every day, and months into us talking I started developing feelings for them. I was much too shy about acting upon these feelings though, so I kept them to myself, not thinking that they would ever return the feelings.</p>

                        <p>That was, until very early into October 24th, 2019, when we finally confessed our feelings for each other!</p>

                        <p>From there, our relationship has been flourishing, and we've been growing as people together ever since. Even after all these years, it still feels like a dream come true that they like me back and that we've been together for this long. Ghost makes me feel like the luckiest man alive, I wouldn't want to have it any other way.</p>

                        <p>And yes, for the record, we're still very much into SOAD. We might not be fixated on it anymore like we used to be, but it's still such an important part of our story that I don't think either of us will ever let go of the sentimental value we hold towards their music. Our fursonas have matching SOAD-inspired markings for a reason! We've even made it a goal of ours to see them live together some day, and we hope we can do that soon!</p>

                        <h1>Our Future</h1>
                        <p>The future is something I either avoid thinking about entirely, or will think about obsessively for days or weeks on end. Considering how unstable my physical health is, there's many different possibilities for my future, and nothing about it is set in stone, which scares me a lot.</p>

                        <p>But even with that being said, even with my fears about the future, Ghost always makes sure to reassure me of what we <em>do</em> have going for us for our future together. We have an incredibly strong relationship and have already been through so many things that have tested it's strength. But yet, we still persevere, which gives me hope for what our future will bring for us. No matter what's happened throughout our relationship, we've never given up on each other, and I know that we'll see through to the end of the obstacles we'll have to face to secure our future together.</p>

                        <p>Nothing may be guaranteed, but we'd be lying if we said we didn't have dreams for what we want our future to look like. We hope that we can move in together in a modest apartment (or even a bungalow house if we ever get that lucky) close to where I already live, being able to make enough money to not only support our basic needs, but to also have a little bit of extra spending money left over to travel together and get nice things for each other every now and then. Honestly, I don't think either of us really need much to be happy—getting to live domestically with each other would be more than enough, and I'm so excited for us to get there. </p>
